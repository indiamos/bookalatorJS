# bookalatorJS
Revisiting a project I cobbled together using Java, Flex, and probably PHP in 2009.

This repo is based on https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker. It uses the [AirBnB flavor](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) of eslint.

To start: npm run start-dev

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

## Deployment

See the boilermaker README for deploy instructions: https://github.com/fullstackacademy/boilermaker
